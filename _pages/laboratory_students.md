## A Note from the PI

> *"Mathematics remains the crown of natural sciences!"*  
> 
> Modern mathematics has even transcended natural science, exploring profoundly abstract realms. Yet it is not an ivory tower—mathematics is deeply practical and transformative. We encourage students to start from small steps and witness how mathematical ideas become real-world productivity.

We warmly welcome motivated students to apply for **Master’s or PhD positions** in our group! Your research journey with us will involve bridging mathematics and engineering through:

1. Identifying and studying theoretical mathematical problems emerging from engineering disciplines;  
2. Applying advanced mathematical tools to solve real-world engineering challenges.

You’ll explore topics aligned with our group’s interests—where theory meets application—and experience the elegance of mathematics as the foundation of scientific reasoning.
